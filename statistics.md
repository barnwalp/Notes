### Statistics vs Machine learning

In statistics, we first define the problem and then get the data while in machine learning we have the data from which we infer the solution. In statistics problems are cheap and data is costly while in machine learning data is cheap but problems are costly.

### Types of statistics [Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive]
#### Definition
1. Descriptive - This defines the problems for us, it locates and isolates it. What is the sale of watches going down?
2. Predictive - Says look at this data and tell me what might happen or what would happen if something is changed. for example if i reduce the price of watches, will more people buy them.
3. Prescriptive - says what to do. here models turns into action.

In a nutshell, Description is how many centuries has Kohli scored, Prediction might be how many centuries Kohli may score in world cup and Prescription might be how can Kohli get more centuries in world cup.

#### Random Variable
a Variable that keeps changing based on several circumstances, eg blood sugar test.

#### Mean, Median and standard deviation

- mean age is 28.78 but median age is 26; median is the age of the
average person and the mean is the average age of a person; if you
sort the data then the middle value is the median. if the there are
even number of points, then average of middle 2 data is the median

- when median is lower than mean then data is called right skewed i.e
if mean - median is +ve, then data is right skewed and vice versa

- standard deviation - how far is every data from the middle. its a measure
of how spread a typical observation is from average. There is another
variable called MAD (mean absolute deivation) where instead of squaring
difference, we take absolute of the difference of current value and mean

- standard deviation is very sensitive to outliers compared to MAD. Larger
the deviation, more it blows up. Both are measure of variablility.

- 33 at 75% point - 24 at 25% point = 50% data lies between 24 to 33
This is call inter-quartile range, which is a difference of data at
75% (quarter-3 or upper quartile) and 25% (quarter-1 or lower quartile)
range = max - min
interquartile range = upper quartile - lower quartile

#### Box plot

- The box plot used to be called box and whisker plot
the upper edge of the box is upper quartile and bottom edge of the
box is lower quartile and a line in between is the median
the end of the whiskers is 1.5 times the interquartile range above
the box

- If a data point lies outside the whisker, it is shown as a point (outlier).
and if data ends before it, whisker also ends

- This box plot is also known as 5-point summary

- From the below box-plot, we can also infer that data is right skewed
as median is closed to the quarte-1
